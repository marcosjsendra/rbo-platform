## Task Details
- **Task**: Create layout components (Header, Footer, Navigation)
- **Phase**: 1 - Setup & Static Pages
- **Date Completed**: May 24, 2025
- **Related Files**:
  - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Header Component**
   - Created a responsive header with the RE/MAX Blue Ocean branding
   - Implemented main navigation links (Listings, Luxury Collection, About, Blog)
   - Added dropdown menus for the About section
   - Included language selector and authentication buttons
   - Made it mobile-responsive with a hamburger menu for smaller screens

2. **Footer Component**
   - Created a comprehensive footer with multiple sections
   - Added company information and mission statement
   - Included quick links to important pages
   - Added contact information with icons
   - Implemented a newsletter subscription form
   - Added social media links
   - Included copyright and legal information

3. **MainLayout Component**
   - Created a layout wrapper that includes both Header and Footer
   - Set up proper metadata and SEO elements
   - Implemented responsive design patterns
   - Added proper TypeScript typing

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensuring the navigation works well on all screen sizes required careful media query handling
   - Solution: Used Tailwind's responsive prefixes and custom media queries where needed

2. **Dropdown Menus**
   - Implementing accessible dropdown menus that work on both desktop and mobile
   - Solution: Used a combination of CSS and React state management for better control

3. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Ensuring proper TypeScript types for all components
   - Solution: Added appropriate interfaces and type definitions

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the layout components across different browsers and devices
   - Verify all links and interactive elements work as expected

2. **Accessibility**
   - Run accessibility audits to ensure the components meet WCAG standards
   - Add proper ARIA labels and roles where needed

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize any images used in the header/footer
   - Consider lazy loading for non-critical components

## Dependencies for Next Task

1. The layout components are now ready to be used in the static pages
2. The navigation structure is in place and can be extended as needed
3. The responsive design provides a solid foundation for the rest of the application
