# Task 2.2.5: Implement Data Synchronization Service

## Overview

This report documents the implementation of the data synchronization service for the RE/MAX Blue Ocean website. The service is responsible for fetching property and agent data from the REI API CCA and storing it in our Supabase database for fast access.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Synchronization Service

The synchronization service is implemented as a modular system with the following components:

- **Main Synchronization Service**: Orchestrates the synchronization process and provides high-level functions for syncing all data or specific entity types.
- **Property Synchronization Module**: Handles the synchronization of property data from the REI API CCA to Supabase.
- **Agent Synchronization Module**: Handles the synchronization of agent data from the REI API CCA to Supabase.

The service includes the following features:

- **Incremental Synchronization**: Only updates records that have changed since the last sync.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes data in configurable batches to avoid memory issues.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging.
- **Sync Metadata**: Tracks synchronization status and timing for different entity types and brands.

### 2. Database Schema Updates

Added a new `sync_metadata` table to track synchronization status:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.sync_metadata (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  entity_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_sync_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  CONSTRAINT sync_metadata_entity_brand_unique UNIQUE (entity_type, brand)
);
```

Also added a `brand` column to both the `properties` and `agents` tables to track which brand (AZURA or BLUE_OCEAN) each record belongs to.

### 3. API Endpoint

Created a REST API endpoint at `/api/sync` to trigger data synchronization:

- **POST /api/sync**: Triggers synchronization with configurable options.
- **GET /api/sync**: Returns information about the sync API.

The API is secured with an API key to prevent unauthorized access.

### 4. Command-Line Tool

Implemented a command-line tool for manual synchronization:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/sync-data.ts --brand=BLUE_OCEAN --entity=properties --force
```

This tool provides a convenient way to trigger synchronization for testing and development purposes.

### 5. Scheduled Jobs

Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run synchronization on a schedule:

- Runs twice daily at 2:00 AM and 2:00 PM UTC.
- Synchronizes both AZURA and BLUE_OCEAN data.
- Supports manual triggering with configurable options.
- Notifies the team if synchronization fails.

## Usage

### API Endpoint

```typescript
// Example API request
const response = await fetch('/api/sync', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': process.env.SYNC_API_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    brand: 'BLUE_OCEAN',
    entityType: 'properties',
    forceSync: true,
    batchSize: 50,
    verbose: false,
  }),
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

### Command-Line Tool

```bash
# Sync all BLUE_OCEAN data
npx tsx scripts/sync-data.ts --brand=BLUE_OCEAN

# Sync only AZURA properties with forced full sync
npx tsx scripts/sync-data.ts --brand=AZURA --entity=properties --force

# Sync BLUE_OCEAN agents with larger batch size and verbose logging
npx tsx scripts/sync-data.ts --brand=BLUE_OCEAN --entity=agents --batch-size=100 --verbose
```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { syncAll, syncPropertiesOnly, syncAgentsOnly } from '@/lib/sync';

// Sync all data for BLUE_OCEAN
const result = await syncAll({
  brand: 'BLUE_OCEAN',
  forceSync: false,
  batchSize: 50,
  verbose: false,
});

console.log(`Sync completed: Added=${result.added}, Updated=${result.updated}`);
```

## Testing

The synchronization service has been tested with both the AZURA and BLUE_OCEAN brands, verifying that:

1. Properties and agents are correctly fetched from the REI API CCA.
2. Data is properly transformed and stored in the Supabase database.
3. Incremental synchronization works as expected, only updating changed records.
4. Error handling correctly handles various failure scenarios.
5. The API endpoint and command-line tool function as expected.

## Code Quality Improvements

### Linting Error Fixes

Recently, several linting errors were addressed across the synchronization service files:

1. **Type Safety Enhancements**:
   - Added proper type annotations for the Supabase client in all synchronization modules
   - Created appropriate type definitions for handling database tables not included in the generated types
   - Fixed type-related linting errors throughout the codebase

2. **Consistent Logging Format**:
   - Standardized logging format across all files to include file paths for better traceability
   - Changed from dynamic `${__filename}` to consistent hardcoded paths (`src/lib/sync/sync-service.ts`)
   - Enhanced error logging with more descriptive messages

3. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Added clear JSDoc comments for all functions and interfaces
   - Fixed duplicate or overlapping JSDoc comments
   - Improved code documentation for better maintainability

4. **Handling Non-Generated Tables**:
   - Implemented a type-safe approach for working with the `sync_metadata` table which exists in the database but isn't included in the generated TypeScript types
   - Used appropriate ESLint disable comments with clear explanations where necessary

These improvements ensure that the synchronization service is now fully compliant with the project's linting rules while maintaining type safety and code quality.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Zone Matching**: Enhance the zone matching logic to accurately determine which zone a property belongs to based on its location or coordinates.
2. **Add Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert administrators of synchronization status and any issues.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Further optimize the synchronization process for better performance with large datasets.
4. **Add Analytics**: Track synchronization metrics over time to identify trends and potential issues.
5. **Implement Differential Updates**: Only send changed fields to the database to reduce update overhead.

## Conclusion

The data synchronization service provides a robust and flexible solution for keeping the RE/MAX Blue Ocean website's property and agent data up to date. It handles the complexities of interacting with the REI API CCA and ensures that the local Supabase database always contains the latest information for fast access by the website. With the recent linting fixes and code quality improvements, the synchronization service is now not only functional but also maintainable, type-safe, and compliant with the project's coding standards.
