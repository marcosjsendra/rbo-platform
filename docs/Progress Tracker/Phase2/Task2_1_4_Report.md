# Task 2.1.4: Set up Row Level Security Policies

## Date Completed
May 27, 2025

## Task Description
Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the Supabase database to control access to the RE/MAX Blue Ocean website data, ensuring that public users can only view published property listings, while administrative operations are restricted to authenticated administrators.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enabled Row Level Security for All Tables

Enabled Row Level Security for all tables in the database to ensure that access is controlled by explicit policies:

```sql
-- Enable Row Level Security for all tables
ALTER TABLE properties ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE agents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE zones ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE property_images ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE property_features ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE property_feature_links ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE property_types ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE property_statuses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE agent_zones ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sync_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Created Public Read Access Policies

Implemented policies to allow public read access to published data while restricting write operations:

```sql
-- Properties table - Only show active properties to the public
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to active properties" 
ON properties FOR SELECT 
USING (
  property_status_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM property_statuses 
    WHERE name IN ('Active', 'New', 'Reduced', 'Coming Soon')
  ) OR property_status_id IS NULL
);

-- Agents table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to agents" 
ON agents FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

-- Zones table policies
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to zones" 
ON zones FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

-- Similar policies for other tables...
```

### 3. Created Admin Access Policies

Implemented policies to allow full access to authenticated administrators:

```sql
-- Create a secure API schema for internal operations
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS api;

-- Create a function to check if the current user is an admin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION api.is_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND 
    auth.jwt() ? 'is_admin' AND 
    (auth.jwt()->>'is_admin')::boolean = true
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Properties table admin policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow admin full access to properties" 
ON properties FOR ALL 
USING (api.is_admin());

-- Similar policies for other tables...
```

### 4. Created Service Role Policies

Implemented policies to allow the service role to perform data synchronization operations:

```sql
-- Create a function to check if the current user is a service role
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION api.is_service_role()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.role() = 'service_role';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Properties table service role policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow service role full access to properties" 
ON properties FOR ALL 
USING (api.is_service_role());

-- Similar policies for other tables...
```

### 5. Implemented Special Case Policies

Created specific policies for special cases, such as restricting access to properties based on their status:

```sql
-- Properties table - Only show active properties to the public
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to properties" ON properties;
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to active properties" 
ON properties FOR SELECT 
USING (
  property_status_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM property_statuses 
    WHERE name IN ('Active', 'New', 'Reduced', 'Coming Soon')
  ) OR property_status_id IS NULL
);
```

## Security Model Overview

The implemented Row Level Security policies follow a multi-layered approach:

1. **Public Access Layer**:
   - Anonymous users can only read published property listings, agents, and zones
   - Properties that are not active (e.g., Sold, Pending, Withdrawn) are hidden from public view
   - All supporting data (property types, features, etc.) is readable by the public

2. **Admin Access Layer**:
   - Authenticated users with the `is_admin` claim in their JWT can perform all operations on all tables
   - Admin access is verified through a secure, schema-isolated function (`api.is_admin()`)
   - This allows administrators to manage all aspects of the website data

3. **Service Access Layer**:
   - The service role can perform all operations on all tables
   - This is necessary for automated processes like data synchronization with the REI API CCA
   - Service role access is verified through a secure function (`api.is_service_role()`)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Security and Accessibility
**Challenge**: Needed to ensure that public users could access property listings while preventing unauthorized data modifications.

**Solution**: Implemented granular RLS policies that allow public read access to specific tables and rows while restricting write operations to authenticated administrators and service roles.

### Challenge 2: Handling Property Status Visibility
**Challenge**: Properties with certain statuses (e.g., Sold, Pending) should not be visible to the public.

**Solution**: Created a specific RLS policy for the properties table that only allows public access to properties with active statuses, using a subquery to determine which property status IDs correspond to active listings.

### Challenge 3: Secure Admin Authentication
**Challenge**: Needed a secure way to identify administrators without exposing sensitive information.

**Solution**: Created a security definer function in a separate schema that checks for the presence and value of an `is_admin` claim in the user's JWT, ensuring that admin checks are performed consistently and securely.

## Next Steps

1. Create database indexes for performance optimization (Task 2.1.5)
2. Implement OAuth token management with refresh mechanism (Task 2.2.2)
3. Set up environment variables for API credentials (Task 2.2.3)
4. Create Supabase client utilities for server and client components (Task 2.2.4)
5. Implement data synchronization service (Task 2.2.5)
