# Database Migration Report: sync_metadata Table

**Date:** May 28, 2025  
**Status:** Completed âœ…  
**Migration File:** `/src/lib/supabase/migrations/20250528_create_sync_metadata_table.sql`

## Overview

This report documents the successful implementation of the `sync_metadata` table in the Supabase database. This table is a critical component of the REI API CCA integration, as it tracks synchronization status for different entity types and brands.

## Migration Details

### Tables Created

1. **sync_metadata**
   - Tracks synchronization status for properties and agents
   - Includes brand-specific tracking for both RE/MAX AZURA and RE/MAX BLUE OCEAN
   - Stores timestamps for last successful synchronization

### Schema Changes

1. **Added Brand Column to Existing Tables**
   - Added `brand` column to the `properties` table
   - Added `brand` column to the `agents` table
   - Created indexes on brand columns for faster lookups

2. **Created Automatic Timestamp Updates**
   - Implemented a trigger to automatically update the `updated_at` column
   - Ensures accurate tracking of when records were last modified

### Initial Data

The migration included the creation of initial records for both brands and entity types:

| Entity Type | Brand       | Last Sync Time |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| property    | AZURA       | NOW()          |
| property    | BLUE_OCEAN  | NOW()          |
| agent       | AZURA       | NOW()          |
| agent       | BLUE_OCEAN  | NOW()          |

## Implementation Notes

The migration was implemented with careful consideration for existing data:

1. **Used IF NOT EXISTS Clauses**
   - Prevents errors if tables or columns already exist
   - Makes the migration idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)

2. **Added Constraints and Indexes**
   - Composite unique constraint on entity_type and brand
   - Indexes for faster lookups on frequently queried columns

3. **Added Detailed Comments**
   - Table and column comments for better documentation
   - Clear explanations of each component's purpose

## Next Steps

With the database migration complete, the next steps in the REI API CCA integration are:

1. **Implement Data Access Layer**
   - Create functions for retrieving properties and agents from Supabase
   - Implement filtering and pagination for property and agent queries

2. **Build UI Components**
   - Develop property card and detail components
   - Create agent profile components
   - Implement search and filtering UI

## Conclusion

The successful implementation of the `sync_metadata` table provides a solid foundation for tracking synchronization status in the REI API CCA integration. This will enable more efficient incremental updates and better monitoring of the synchronization process.
