# Project Objective: RE/MAX Blue Ocean Website

**This is the core goal. It is very important to focus only on the following features for the initial release.**

We are building a **real estate website** for **RE/MAX AZURA** and **RE/MAX BLUE OCEAN** that includes:

- Stable static content - in progress - needs improvement
- Retrieval of properties and agents from the **REI API CCA**, and storing them in our local database (Supabase) for fast access
- Search and filter functionality for property listings
- Property cards and individual property detail pages
- Agent cards and individual agent detail pages
- Zones (Nosara, Punta Islita, Samara, Playa Marbella, Puerto Carrillo, Playa Ostional) Cards

**This is all we want to implement for now. Please focus solely on these six features.**
