# Error Handling and mock Data

## Error Handling

- If I encounter an error (in console, frontend, or IDE), I will report it at:
  `/remax-blueocean/docs/Errors/reported/phase*/`
  and share the file or its content with you.

- Your task is to fix the error and submit a report at:
  `/remax-blueocean/docs/Errors/fixedReport/phase*/`

- Reports must include:
  - Description of the error
  - What was changed or fixed
  - Affected files or code

## Mock Data

Do not create or use mock data.

All testing and implementation must use real data from the REI API CCA.

If a request fails, return the actual error response and explain it.
I need to see real data and real errors to debug and reach a stable implementation.
