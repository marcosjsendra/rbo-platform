### SECTION 1: UNDERSTANDING BLUE ZONES

**Understanding Blue Zones**

In a society where longevity and well-being are so important, the concept of Blue Zones has piqued the interest of many. Blue Zones are locations around the world that have been found to be home to an unusually high number of centenarians—individuals living at least 100 years.

In these areas, people live much longer, healthier lives than the global norm. Researchers have conducted substantial research in these areas in order to uncover the secrets of longevity and well-being. The Costa Rica Blue Zone is found in the Nicoya Peninsula, home to RE/MAX Blue Ocean.
