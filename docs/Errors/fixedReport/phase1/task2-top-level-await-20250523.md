# Fixed: Top-level await in tailwind.config.ts

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: SyntaxError
- **File**: `tailwind.config.ts`
- **Error Message**: `await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules`
- **Date Fixed**: 2025-05-23

## Issue Description
The error occurred because the Tailwind configuration file was using top-level `await` to dynamically import plugins, which is not supported in the current module context.

## Root Cause
- The configuration was using an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) with `await` at the top level
- Dynamic imports with `import()` were being used unnecessarily for Tailwind plugins
- This approach caused issues with the module evaluation during the build process

## Solution
1. Replaced dynamic imports with static imports for all Tailwind plugins
2. Removed the async/await pattern that was causing the issue
3. Simplified the plugin imports to use direct static imports

## Files Modified
- `tailwind.config.ts`

## Verification
After making these changes:
1. The development server should start without the top-level await error
2. Tailwind CSS should be properly processed and applied to the application
3. All Tailwind utilities and components should work as expected

## Prevention
- Avoid using top-level await in configuration files
- Use static imports when possible instead of dynamic imports for better build-time optimization
- Keep configuration files simple and synchronous when possible
