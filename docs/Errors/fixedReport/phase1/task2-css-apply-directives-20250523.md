# Fixed: @apply Directives in Base Layer

## Original Error
- **Date**: 2025-05-23
- **File**: `globals.css`
- **Error Type**: CSS compilation error
- **Error Message**: Issues with `@apply` directives in base layer
- **Reported In**: `reported/Failedtocompile-05232025-5.md`

## Error Details
The error occurred because we were using `@apply` directives in the `@layer base` section, which can cause issues with how Tailwind processes the styles. The `@apply` directive should typically be used in component layers or utility layers, not in the base layer.

## Root Cause
1. Using `@apply` in `@layer base` can lead to specificity and ordering issues
2. The `border-border-color` and `bg-background` utilities might not be properly defined or accessible in the base layer
3. The CSS variables are defined correctly, but the way they're being applied needs adjustment

## Solution Implemented
1. **Moved base styles** to use direct CSS properties instead of `@apply`:
   ```css
   @layer base {
     * {
       border-color: hsl(var(--border));
     }
     body {
       background-color: hsl(var(--background));
       color: hsl(var(--foreground));
       font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Ensured all color variables** are properly referenced with `hsl()`

## Verification
- The base styles are now applied correctly
- No more compilation errors related to `@apply` in base layer
- The layout renders as expected in both light and dark modes

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Avoid using `@apply` in `@layer base`
2. Use direct CSS properties for base styles
3. Keep `@apply` for component or utility layers where it's more appropriate
