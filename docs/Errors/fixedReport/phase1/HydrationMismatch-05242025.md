# Hydration Mismatch Error Fix Report

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: React Hydration Mismatch
- **Date Fixed**: May 24, 2025
- **Related Task**: Task 3 - Create Layout Components
- **Related Files**:
  - `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`

## Error Description
The application was showing a React hydration mismatch warning in the browser console. The error occurred due to a mismatch between server-side rendered (SSR) content and client-side hydration, specifically related to DOM attributes added by browser extensions.

## Root Cause
1. The error was triggered by a `cz-shortcut-listen` attribute that was being added to the `body` tag by a browser extension (likely "Czech Keyboard" or similar).
2. This attribute was present in the server-rendered HTML but not in the client-side React tree, causing a hydration mismatch.
3. The issue was particularly noticeable in development mode with React's strict mode enabled.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Root Layout Updates (`layout.tsx`)
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to both `html` and `body` tags to prevent React from warning about attributes added by browser extensions.

```typescript
// Before
<html lang="en">
  <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
    {children}
  </body>
</html>

// After
<html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <body 
    className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
    suppressHydrationWarning
  >
    {children}
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. MainLayout Component Updates (`MainLayout.tsx`)
- Added client-side mounting logic to prevent hydration mismatches
- Implemented a loading state to delay rendering until the component is mounted on the client
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the main container div
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables

```typescript
'use client';

import { ReactNode, useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Inside the component:
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);

if (!mounted) {
  return null;
}

return (
  <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col" suppressHydrationWarning>
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
);
```

## Prevention Measures
1. **Client-Side Only Components**: For components that rely on browser APIs or are affected by browser extensions, we now ensure they only render on the client side.
2. **Strict Mode Awareness**: The solution takes into account React's Strict Mode in development, which can cause double-rendering of effects.
3. **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and variables to maintain code quality.

## Testing
1. Verified that the hydration warning no longer appears in the browser console
2. Confirmed that the layout renders correctly on both initial load and client-side navigation
3. Tested with and without browser extensions to ensure consistent behavior

## Impact
This fix improves the development experience by eliminating console warnings and ensures more consistent rendering between server and client. It also makes the application more resilient to browser extensions that might modify the DOM.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the application for any other hydration-related issues
2. Consider implementing automated tests to catch similar issues early in the development process
3. Document this pattern for future components that might need similar client-side mounting logic
