# REI API CCA Authentication Error Fix Report

## Error Description

**Error Type**: Authentication Failure  
**Error Message**: `unsupported_grant_type` and `unauthorized_client`  
**Affected Component**: REI API CCA Authentication  
**Date Fixed**: 2025-05-25  

### Error Details

The authentication with the REI API CCA was failing with the following errors:

```
[Server] Authentication failed: Error [AxiosError]: Request failed with status code 400
[Server] Response status: 400
[Server] Response data: { error: 'unsupported_grant_type' }
```

After changing the authentication approach, we received a different error:

```
{"status":"error","message":"Authentication failed","error":"Request failed with status code 400","details":{"error":"unauthorized_client"}}
```

These errors occurred when attempting to authenticate with the REI API CCA using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The authentication endpoint was correctly accessible, but the request format was not matching what the API expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we identified several problems with the authentication request:

1. **Incorrect Request Format**: The initial implementation was using a non-standard format with a leading `=` character in the request body.

2. **Incorrect Grant Type**: We tried using `client_credentials` grant type, but the API specifically requires the `password` grant type as per the documentation.

3. **Parameter Case Sensitivity**: The API expects parameters with specific casing (`integratorID` instead of `integratorId`).

4. **Parameter Structure**: The parameters needed to be properly URL-encoded and formatted according to the OAuth 2.0 specification.

## Solution Implemented

We modified the authentication implementation in `/src/app/api/rei-cca/auth/route.ts` to:

1. Use the standard OAuth 2.0 `password` grant type as specified in the REI API CCA documentation.

2. Properly format the request parameters using `URLSearchParams` to ensure correct encoding.

3. Use the exact parameter names and casing as expected by the API (`integratorID` and `secretkey`).

4. Include the `apikey` parameter as required by the API.

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Before:
const requestBody = `=grant_type=password&apikey=${credentials.apiKey}&integratorID=${credentials.integratorId}&secretkey=${credentials.secretKey}`;

// After:
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append('grant_type', 'password'); // Use password grant type as specified in docs
params.append('apikey', credentials.apiKey);
params.append('integratorID', credentials.integratorId); // Use exact case as in documentation
params.append('secretkey', credentials.secretKey);

const requestBody = params.toString();
```

## Verification

The fix was verified by successfully obtaining an authentication token from the REI API CCA. The response included:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Authentication successful",
  "data": {
    "access_token": "ty6fSM-60enet1TMN8eSVEYL_8B9Mj8qaoayf66RrkAr8ufwzZnRQ-VeMmtgi_cq_wQTtBCJnXYxPXSVR3kA5oACzYfU6ybFYGn1M7bfOKuhPMgcfvxQXCamjMFgwmepkLTiIJPdn2w5p_H0sFEHbv3QH7Rg_Psqx-3y3vAbohDEvYQoOQIyZLkCs3HlnIOLG_1cRtKmKSVHSVtQnqlbCqi3dW4Mv1rSyEJ5skF0ycEyHR8Uw840rsY-d3am4XH-hLyUtUANYIO8fM8R32l178NmfHq9TdO6fjBgnAyi7j1I-7SiD7b_sSTSOC0tK7G3zBXSXbdzIWh4-t-XRfFzbw",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 86399
  }
}
```

This confirms that the authentication is now working correctly, and the token can be used for subsequent API requests.

## Impact

This fix enables the application to:

1. Successfully authenticate with the REI API CCA
2. Retrieve properties and agents from the API
3. Store data in the local database for fast access
4. Implement the property and agent search functionality

This resolves a critical blocker for Phase 2 of the RE/MAX Blue Ocean website implementation, allowing the development of property listings and agent profiles to proceed.

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Documentation Precision**: Follow API documentation exactly, including parameter names, casing, and formats.

2. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**: Different APIs may implement OAuth 2.0 with specific variations. Always verify the exact requirements.

3. **Detailed Error Logging**: The detailed error logging we implemented was crucial in diagnosing and fixing the issue.

4. **Testing Approach**: Testing with multiple authentication approaches helped identify the correct solution.

## Next Steps

1. Implement token caching to improve performance
2. Add automatic token refresh before expiration (tokens expire after ~24 hours)
3. Proceed with implementing the property and agent retrieval functionality
