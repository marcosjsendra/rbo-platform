# Error Fix Report: API Authentication Network Error

## Error Description

The API test page was encountering network errors when attempting to authenticate with the REI API CCA. The specific errors were:

1. **Network Error**: The browser was unable to make a direct connection to the REI API CCA endpoint.
   ```
   AxiosError: Network Error
   at XMLHttpRequest.handleError
   ```

2. **Authentication Failure**: As a result of the network error, the authentication process failed.
   ```
   Error: Failed to authenticate with REI API CCA
   ```

These errors were occurring due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions, which prevent browser-based JavaScript from making direct API calls to different domains unless the server explicitly allows it.

## Changes Made

To fix this issue, we implemented a server-side API route in Next.js to proxy the requests to the REI API CCA. This approach avoids CORS restrictions because the requests are made from the server rather than directly from the browser.

### 1. Created a Server-Side API Route

Created a new file at `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts` that:
- Handles authentication with the REI API CCA
- Proxies API requests to avoid CORS issues
- Manages token storage and refresh
- Provides proper error handling

### 2. Modified the API Client

Updated the API client in `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts` to:
- Use the server-side API route instead of making direct API calls
- Simplify the request methods by using a common `makeRequest` method
- Remove client-side token management (now handled on the server)
- Maintain the same API interface for seamless integration

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Error

Fixed a TypeScript error in the API route related to handling unknown error types:
- Changed `error.message` to `error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'`
- This ensures proper type checking and prevents runtime errors

## Affected Files

1. `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts` (New file)
   - Created a server-side API route to proxy requests to the REI API CCA

2. `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts`
   - Modified to use the server-side API route instead of making direct API calls
   - Simplified the implementation while maintaining the same API interface

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the API test page should now be able to:
1. Successfully authenticate with the REI API CCA
2. Make API calls to retrieve properties, agents, and lookup data
3. Display the results without CORS or network errors

The server-side API route approach provides several benefits:
- Avoids CORS restrictions
- Improves security by keeping API credentials on the server
- Centralizes token management
- Simplifies error handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the API test page to verify that the authentication and API calls are working correctly
2. Implement proper error handling and loading states in the API test page
3. Continue with the implementation of the property and agent pages using the updated API client
