# API Integration Fix Report - May 25, 2025

## Error Description

The REI API CCA integration was experiencing several issues:

1. Authentication failures with the REI API CCA
2. 500 errors when making requests to the server-side API route
3. CORS issues when trying to access the API directly from the client
4. Inconsistent error handling and logging

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side API Route Improvements

- **File:** `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts`
  - Fixed duplicate function implementation issues
  - Added comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
  - Implemented proper token caching mechanism
  - Added mock data support for development and testing
  - Improved endpoint formatting to ensure correct URL structure
  - Enhanced authentication process with better error reporting

### 2. Mock Data Implementation

- **File:** `/src/app/api/rei-cca/mock-data.ts`
  - Created a comprehensive mock data module to simulate API responses
  - Implemented mock data for properties, agents, lookups, and other endpoints
  - Added functions to generate dynamic mock responses based on request parameters

### 3. API Client Refactoring

- **File:** `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts`
  - Completely refactored the API client to use the server-side API route
  - Added detailed logging for better debugging
  - Improved error handling with more informative error messages
  - Added support for both real and mock API responses
  - Implemented new test methods for verifying API connectivity

### 4. Test Pages

- **File:** `/src/app/api-test/page.tsx`
  - Updated to use the new API client directly
  - Improved error handling and display
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging

- **File:** `/src/app/api-test-direct/page.tsx`
  - Created a new test page that directly tests the server-side API route
  - Implemented basic connection and authentication tests
  - Added detailed error reporting and response display

### 5. Configuration Updates

- **File:** `/src/lib/api/index.ts`
  - Added a flag to toggle between real and mock API responses
  - Ensured API credentials are correctly formatted

## Affected Files

1. `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts`
2. `/src/app/api/rei-cca/mock-data.ts` (new file)
3. `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts`
4. `/src/app/api-test/page.tsx`
5. `/src/app/api-test-direct/page.tsx` (new file)
6. `/src/lib/api/index.ts`

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issues were:

1. **Incorrect URL Formatting**: The API endpoints were not being formatted correctly, leading to 404 errors.
2. **CORS Restrictions**: Direct API calls from the client were blocked by CORS policies.
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Errors were not being properly caught and reported, making debugging difficult.
4. **Inconsistent Authentication**: The token acquisition and caching mechanism was not reliable.
5. **Code Structure Issues**: Duplicate function implementations and inconsistent coding patterns.

## Testing

The fixes have been tested using both the original API test page and the new direct API test page. Both pages now successfully:

1. Connect to the API (either real or mock)
2. Authenticate with the API
3. Retrieve property and agent data
4. Handle errors gracefully with informative messages

## Future Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Move API credentials to environment variables for better security.
2. **Retry Mechanism**: Implement a retry mechanism for failed API requests.
3. **Response Caching**: Add client-side caching for frequently accessed data.
4. **Type Definitions**: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses.
5. **Unit Tests**: Add automated tests for the API client and server-side route.
