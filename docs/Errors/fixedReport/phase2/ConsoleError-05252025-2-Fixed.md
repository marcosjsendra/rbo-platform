# Error Fix Report: API Route 500 Error

## Error Description

The API test page was encountering a 500 error when attempting to make requests to our server-side API route. The specific error was:

```
AxiosError: Request failed with status code 500
```

This error occurred when the client attempted to make a request to the server-side API route. The issue was related to how we were handling the API endpoints and URLs in both the client and server components.

## Root Causes

After investigation, we identified several issues that were causing the 500 error:

1. **URL Formatting Issues**: The API endpoints were not being properly formatted, leading to invalid URLs when making requests to the REI API CCA.

2. **Error Handling Limitations**: The error handling in both the client and server components was not providing enough information to diagnose the issue.

3. **Authentication Flow**: The authentication process was not properly handling the token acquisition and management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-Side API Route Improvements

Modified the server-side API route in `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts` to:

- Properly format API URLs by ensuring consistent handling of slashes
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Improve error handling with detailed error information
- Fix the authentication URL construction

Key changes:
```typescript
// Ensure the API URL has the correct format
const apiBaseUrl = credentials.apiUrl.endsWith('/') 
  ? credentials.apiUrl.slice(0, -1) 
  : credentials.apiUrl;

// Ensure the endpoint has the correct format
const formattedEndpoint = endpoint.startsWith('/') 
  ? endpoint 
  : `/${endpoint}`;

// Build the full URL
let url = `${apiBaseUrl}${formattedEndpoint}`;
```

### 2. Client-Side API Client Improvements

Updated the API client in `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts` to:

- Ensure consistent endpoint formatting
- Add more detailed logging for requests and responses
- Improve error handling with detailed error information
- Fix the request payload structure

Key changes:
```typescript
// Ensure the endpoint has the correct format
const formattedEndpoint = endpoint.startsWith('/') ? endpoint : `/${endpoint}`;

// Make the request to the server-side API route
const response = await this.axiosInstance.post('', {
  endpoint: formattedEndpoint,
  params,
  brand: this.brand,
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging

Added comprehensive error logging to both client and server components:

- Detailed request and response logging
- Structured error information
- API response data and status codes
- Authentication process details

## Affected Files

1. `/src/app/api/rei-cca/route.ts`
   - Fixed URL formatting
   - Added detailed logging
   - Improved error handling

2. `/src/lib/api/rei-api-cca.ts`
   - Fixed endpoint formatting
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Improved request structure

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the API test page should now be able to:
1. Successfully authenticate with the REI API CCA
2. Make API calls to retrieve properties, agents, and lookup data
3. Display the results without 500 errors

The improved logging will also make it easier to diagnose any future issues that may arise.

## Next Steps

1. Test the API test page to verify that the authentication and API calls are working correctly
2. Monitor the server logs for any remaining issues
3. Consider implementing additional error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Continue with the implementation of the property and agent pages using the updated API client
