For the RE/MAX Blue Ocean project, follow this workflow for task tracking:

1. Implementation Plan Location: c:\dev\docs\implementation_plan.md

   - Contains 4 main phases with specific tasks
   - Each task should be marked with [x] when completed

2. Progress Tracking Location: c:\dev\docs\Progress Tracker\

   - Create detailed reports for each completed task
   - Organize reports by phase (Phase1, Phase2, etc.)
   - Use consistent naming: TaskX_Y_Z_Report.md (e.g., Task1_4_2_Report.md)

3. After completing a task:

   - Create a detailed report in the Progress Tracker
   - Update the implementation_plan.md to mark the task as complete [x]
   - Link the report to the task in implementation_plan.md using relative paths

4. Report Format:
   - Include task description
   - Document what was implemented
   - Note any challenges and how they were resolved
   - Include relevant code snippets or screenshots
   - Link to any related files or resources

Always review the entire content file before implementing any feature or page. For markdown files, check all sections and subsections to ensure complete implementation. Pay special attention to content below the initial view and verify against all headings and bullet points in the source document.
